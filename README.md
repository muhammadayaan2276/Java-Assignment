## Project Portfolio Description

This collection includes Java programs covering:

- **Arithmetic operations** (circle area, percentage, discounted price)  
- **Conditional logic** (even/odd numbers, triangle validation)  
- **Geometry** (triangle area using Heron’s formula, trapezoid area)  
- **Power calculations** (voltage × current)  

These exercises helped me understand basic programming, practice problem-solving, and improve my coding skills in Java.
